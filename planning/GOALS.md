# Project Goals (`planning/GOALS.md`)

Last Updated: 2026-11-07
Source State: STATE_18.md (Orchestration 18 complete; `cargo test` 31 unit + 10 integration; `cargo clippy --all-targets` clean; `make test` runs Rust, Pi and hook suites)

## Circled Goal (Active)

- None. G17–G21 are complete (see Completed).

## Sequenced Goals (Dependency DAG)

- None open.

## Independent Backlog

- None.

## Deferred

- **[G9]** Full-state broadcast cost is reduced to diffs (ADR 0008 upgrade path). Depends on G5 (complete).
  - Trigger: measurable HUD lag, or agent counts that make full-list pushes noticeable.
- **[G10]** `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is honored for the config path (ADR 0010 negative).
  - Trigger: a user request or a packaging need. Kept separate from G17 by decision on 2026-11-07.

## Blocked / Pruned

- **[G15]** An Antigravity sidecar integration exists in this repo. `integrations/antigravity/` has a README only.
  - Status: Blocked / External Watch
  - Reason: the sidecar is built and owned outside this repo. It depends on Antigravity's API, which is not available here.
- **[G11]** Adopt the JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope from the design doc.
  - Status: Pruned
  - Reason: ADR 0004 rejected it; the newline-delimited JSON protocol is in use.

## Completed

- **[G17]** The daemon socket and agent logs live in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/swayve/` (0700). Refuses to start without `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. Stale-socket removal only deletes a socket owned by the current user. Commit `cc35bfd`. Live check still open: start the daemon and confirm the socket and directory mode (`planning/STATE_18.md`).
- **[G18]** README CLI reference lists `init-shell`, `status [--json] [--watch]`, and `focus --cycle` (18.2.1).
- **[G19]** `cargo clippy --all-targets` is clean (18.2.2).
- **[G20]** `make test` runs Rust, Pi and hook tests (18.2.3).
- **[G21]** Unit tests pin the Sway command strings and `AgentStatus`/`AgentId` JSON and marks (18.2.4).
- **[G14]** Planning waves 1–14 archived into `planning/archive/` with `git mv` (17.1.3).
- **[G13]** Daemon-down fallback test: `test_flat_fallback_cycles_agent_windows_in_tree_order` (17.1.1). README and ADR 0003 say the fallback cycles agent windows only (17.1.2).
- **[G16]** Stale docs and CLI trap fixed. Commits `398fa92`, `66ef55c`.
- **[G12]** Malformed config reported live. Checked 2026-11-07 (`planning/STATE_16.md`).
- **[G1]** Daemon focus follows Sway's actual focus. Commit `436b190`. Live check passed on 2026-11-07.
- **[G2]** Focus-state decision recorded as ADR 0011. Commit `874d7db`.
- **[G3]** Malformed config reports an error and falls back to defaults. Commit `5788c3e`.
- **[G4]** Children-mark rehome covered with several surviving siblings. Commit `3422164`. Live check passed on 2026-11-07.
- **[G5]** Subscriber drop-on-full policy recorded in ADR 0008 and covered by a test. Commit `55314d4`.
- **[G6]** Daemon-down fallback decided: the CLI keeps the flat fallback. Commit `d313105`.
- **[G7]** Planning docs reconciled. Commit `ccf52a7`.
- **[G8]** Test layout and CI convention recorded in `AGENTS.md`. Commit `d313105`.
